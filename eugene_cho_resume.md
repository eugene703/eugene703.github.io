I solve complex business problems with AI by turning ambiguity into clear, high-impact solutions. As an AI Team Lead, I own initiatives end-to-end—from identifying the right problems to deploying production systems that materially improve how organizations operate. I focus on applying AI where it drives measurable outcomes, embedding it into core workflows and optimizing for performance, cost, and scalability. My goal is simple: deliver practical AI solutions that create lasting operational and business value.
